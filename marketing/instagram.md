Your AI coding assistant has amnesia. 🧠❌

Every session:
→ "Always add error handling"
→ "Follow our naming conventions"
→ "Don't skip security checks"

...and it forgets. Again.

AI Workflow Manager gives Claude a permanent memory + automatic rule injection. 4 systems. Zero babysitting.

📚 Auto-injects the right manuals per task
🧠 Persistent project memory

## Post 2: Before/After Carousel

**Slide 1 — Cover:**
AI coding without structure vs. with AI Workflow Manager 🧵

**Slide 2 — Before:**
❌ Without AI Workflow Manager
• Repeats the same rules every session
• Claude ignores security requirements
• No record of what files were changed
• Starts from scratch after every break
• Random code quality

**Slide 3 — After:**
✅ With AI Workflow Manager
• Right manuals auto-injected per task
• Security rules always included for auth tasks
• MODIFIED_FILES logged every response
• /continue loads full project context
• 7-point quality gate enforced

**Slide 4 — How it works:**
Type: "Add user login endpoint"
System detects: api + auth + endpoint
Auto-injects: Backend Rules + Security Rules
Quality gate: 7 checks before response

"Your AI coding assistant is only as good as the rules you give it."

**Problem (3-8s):**
[Screen recording: user typing "add error handling" for the 10th time]
"Tired of repeating yourself?"

**Solution (8-13s):**
[Screen recording: task typed → manuals highlight green → structured response]
"AI Workflow Manager auto-injects the right rules. Every time."

**CTA (13-15s):**
