# Facebook Ad Copy — AI Workflow Manager

## Ad 1: Pain Point (Awareness)

**Headline:** Your AI coding assistant keeps making the same mistakes. Here's the fix.

**Body:**
Tired of telling Claude or ChatGPT the same rules every single session?
"Always add error handling." "Follow our naming conventions." "Don't forget security checks."

They forget. Every. Time.

AI Workflow Manager solves this with 4 external systems that keep your AI teammate consistent — manuals, memory, quality gates, and shortcuts.

🔧 Auto-injects the right coding rules based on your task
🧠 Persistent memory that survives every session
✅ Mandatory quality gate on every single response
⚡ One-click shortcuts for /plan, /review, /continue

Open source. Built with Next.js + Claude.

## Ad 2: Social Proof (Consideration)

**Headline:** Developers are turning their AI from a junior dev into a senior teammate

**Body:**
The problem with AI coding tools isn't the AI — it's the lack of structure.

Here's what happens without AI Workflow Manager:
❌ Claude forgets your project conventions
❌ Every session starts from scratch
❌ Security rules? Ignored again
❌ "MODIFIED_FILES"? Never logged

Here's what happens with it:
✅ Backend task? backend_rules.md auto-injected
✅ Auth task? security_rules.md auto-injected
✅ Memory loaded: project plan + checklist every time
✅ 7-point quality gate on every response

Built on Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind, and the Claude API.
